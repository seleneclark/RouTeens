# RouTeens
RouTeens is an iPhone App designed to help teenagers with executive functioning deficits to accomplish tasks.  More specific than a to-do list, RouTeens will organize items through different routines.  For instance, someone might have a morning routine with items like “brush teeth”, “make lunch”, and “get backpack”. And an afternoon routine that includes "do homework", "walk dog", "practice piano".

A person who struggles with executive functioning skills has trouble with task initiation, persistence, sustained attention, time management, planning/prioritization, organization, and metacognition [1]. All these things can interfere with something as simple as getting ready for school or getting ready for bed.  It is incredibly frustrating for the person suffering and can cause problems with interpersonal relationships. Aids to help practice executive functioning skills can build those skills as well as provide boosts to self-esteem and a feeling of accomplishment. The book, “Smart but Scattered Teens” recommends using checklists as aids and recommends incorporating “the use of electronic media into the plan [1].”

Routeens has a collection of tasks that need to be accomplished at a certain time, in a routine. It is like a to-do list except the tasks are situationally organized by time. Traditional to-do lists have a flaw that if you don’t check them off, they stay around.  These tasks will only appear to remind a person to do them.  There are a lot of to-do and reminder apps but this one is specifically designed with executive functioning in mind (as seen in people with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) or ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder).
